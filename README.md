## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"OpenAI API key not found"**
- Ensure your API key is set correctly
- Check environment variables or Streamlit secrets

**"The model gpt-4 does not exist or you do not have access to it"**
- This means you don't have GPT-4 access (most common issue)
- **Solution**: Use the model selector in the sidebar and choose "gpt-3.5-turbo"
- GPT-4 requires a paid OpenAI account with API billing set up
- GPT-3.5-turbo works with all OpenAI accounts (free and paid)

**"No text found in PDF"**
- The PDF might be scanned or image-based
- Try a different document with selectable text

**"Error extracting text"**
- The PDF might be corrupted or password-protected
- Try uploading a different file

**Slow responses**
- This is normal for GPT-4 processing
- Responses typically take 10-30 seconds

### Getting an OpenAI API Key

1. Go to [OpenAI's website](https://openai.com/api/)
2. Sign up or log in to your account
3. Navigate to API keys section
4. Create a new API key
5. Copy and use in the application

### Checking GPT-4 Access

To check if you have GPT-4 access:

1. **Free Accounts**: Only have access to GPT-3.5-turbo
2. **Paid Accounts**: Need to:
   - Add billing information
   - Make at least one successful payment
   - Wait for GPT-4 access to be enabled (usually immediate)

3. **Test Access**: Use the model selector in the app - if GPT-4 fails, switch to GPT-3.5-turbo
